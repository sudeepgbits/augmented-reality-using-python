# Augmented reality using python
Problem Overview

A glass/windshield manufacturer wants to develop an interactive screen that can be used in cars and eyeglasses. They have partnered with a billboard manufacturer in order to render certain marketing products according to each customer’s preferences. 

Their goal is to detect four points (markers) currently present in the screen’s field-of-view and insert an image or video in the scene. To help with this task, the advertising company is installing blank billboards with four distinct markers, which determine the area’s intended four corners.  The advertising company plans to insert a target image / video into this space. 

They have hired you to produce the necessary software to make this happen. They have set up their sensors so that you will receive an image / video feed and a target image / video. They expect an altered image / video that contains the target content rendered in the scene, visible in the screen.   

## Instructions to run the program:
	1) copy a video in input_videos directory on which you want the picture/video to be projected upon
	2) set input/output video names in experiment.py
	3) Run experiment.py 
	4) the processed videos will get stored in output directory.
